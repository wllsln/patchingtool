# patchingtool

Suggestions for improvement:
* use argparse to setup usage information
* pull the patching list from bugzilla by providing a bz ticket number
    * use the requests package
    * see if bugzilla has an API
* support other diff tool besides meld
* option to specify dpkg_list instead of pulling from remote machine
