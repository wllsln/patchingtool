# patchingtool

Suggestions for improvement:
* write script to compare only libraries being upgraded
* use argparse to setup usage information
* pull the patching list from bugzilla by providing a bz ticket number
    * use the requests package
    * see if bugzilla has an API
* support other diff tool besides meld
